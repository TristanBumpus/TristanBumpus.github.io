          <h2>Devlog</h2>
          <p>
            This was a game made in 48 hours for the ValleyField Intercollegial
            game Jam 2026. The theme was vessel and the team decided to make a
            parite looting game. In this game I made cutscenes and changeable
            keybindings for the first time. Overall we where able to keep the
            game in a small enough scoop and the development went smoothly.
