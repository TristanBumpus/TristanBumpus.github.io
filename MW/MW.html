          <p>
            This was a game made in about a week as a personnal jam between me
            and a friend. The game was in preperation for a competition coming
            up in ValleyField. The game was made using Godot and all assets were
            made in Maya and Asprite. With every game I try to learn something
            new and with this one I published my first 3D game, I worked on
            optimizations and 3D pathfinding.
